# Hand-gesture-recognition - using Machine Learning is like teaching computers to understand and respond to the movements of our hands. It's a powerful innovation that has many practical uses. For example, it can help people who can't speak communicate through sign language or improve how we play video games, take care of our health, and stay safe in cars. This technology makes it easier for computers to understand and react to the natural movements of our hands, making virtual experiences more immersive and improving our daily lives. As researchers continue to work on it, we can expect even more natural and inclusive ways for people and computers to collaborate in the future.
